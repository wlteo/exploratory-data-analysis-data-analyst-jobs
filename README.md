# exploratory-data-analysis-data-analyst-jobs
Exploratory data analysis of a data analyst jobs data set (how many times have i said data already?)

## About this data
This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs) was created by [picklesueat](https://github.com/picklesueat/data_jobs_data) and contains more than 2000 job listing for data analyst positions, with features such as:

- Salary Estimate
- Location
- Company Rating
- Job Description
- and more.

## List of things we will explore:
- Which sectors and industries pay the highest?
- Which sectors and industries have the most available jobs?
 > There's no point finding out which industry/sectors pays handsomely if there are only a handful of jobs available right?
- The top and bottom 25 cities in terms of salaries
- States that pay the best salaries
- Effect of Company Size/Age on salaries
 > Do larger or older companies pay more? We find out!
- How much better do senior-level jobs pay?
